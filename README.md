# liri-node-app

Summary
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
